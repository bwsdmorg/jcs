## What is this?
This project started as a crazy idea I had to build a carputer for my Jeep. I wasnt 100% happy with the software options out there, so I decided to build my own. The idea is to have a system that has navigation and music playing capabilities via spotify. I dont know if all of my ideas are possible, but Im willing to try.

Eventually I would like to add the ability to back things up to my home network when in range, but all in due time. Once I get a working version of this software made, I will be working on testing it on portable computer hardware, such as a Raspberry Pi. At the time of writing, there are other possible contenders for the processing power, but all that could change when I get to a point where I can test this thing.
